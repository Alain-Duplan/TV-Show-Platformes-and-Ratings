# TV-Show-Platforms-and-Ratings

Using R and Tableau, we explored a Kaggle dataset containing the IMBd and Rotten Tomatoes scores of various TV shows and movies. We hope to identify numerous different relationships between the variable in our data set including, but not limited to the relationship between the two scoring metrics and platform availability and scoring. Using KNN clustering and random forests, we created predictive models with the purpose of analyzing the relationships and our tasks.

This project was originally created for the Spring 2021 OIM 454 course at UMass Amherst.
